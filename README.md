The parent class in my program is Espresso with the the variables quanityOfCoffee of type int, quantityOfWater of type int, sugar of type boolea and typeOfCoffee of
type String. Americano inherits all the fields from Esspresso and and a new one, hotWater of type int. Then there is VietnameseCoffee that inherites everything from American 
and adds condesedMilk.
Then there is also a class CoffeeWithMilk that inherites everything from esppresso and adds milk and foam of type int. From CoffeeWithMilk we have classes like 
Frappe that adds ice, Cappucino that uses all the fields from CoffeeWithMilk and Esspresso at the same time but doesn't add anything, Macchiato, FlatWhite, that
has the same fields as cappucino but has different numbers.
Affogato inherits from Espresso and add iceCreamm but IrishCoffee adds Cream and whiskey.
